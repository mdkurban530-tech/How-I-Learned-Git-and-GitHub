Process to gitðŸ˜Š  installation

1) First Visit on website (git-scm.com) to download it .
2) After downloading and installing an option will pop up to Launch Git Bash (this is the environment where we can run git commands)
3) As a result Git Bash will open and we see at the top right corner our local server address is written (e.g: user@Desktop..)
4) Then I have to set username and email_address to manage the git account 
    git config --global user.name "Md Kurban"
    git config --global user.email "mdkurban530@gmail.com"
  
After that we can verify username and email_address
  
    git config  user.name 
    git config  user.email
