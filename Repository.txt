Commands to link the files into our local git account as Repository

1) git add Git.txt 
2) git add GitHub.txt
3) git add Repository.txt
----
---
** but for all files to add at once git add .

3) to check whether files are added or not we write:
  git status
 
4) As our files are added but they are still in the staging area so to confirm to add at the Repository 
   we write:  git commit

**   But it is good practice to add a msg along with the commit command 
   we write:  git commit -m"adding git, github and Repository files"

5) At last we can verify again whether our files are committed or not

*** If suppose we have changed some content in our files
then for versioning our files we have to again perform git add command and also git commit commands once again
