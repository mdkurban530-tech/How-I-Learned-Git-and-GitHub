Process to Git_Hub installation and Repository setup

1) first I need to visit  github.com > Click on Sign Up >enter email > create password>create user name
 
2) after that a confirmation email would be sent to our email id by confirming that our github account would be created

3) click on (+) choose new repository>add repository_name> create repository

4) since we have already created repository we need to push that into git.
  we write:
     
          git remote add origin https://github.com/kurban530/GithubProfile.git
          git branch -M main
          git push -u origin main
5)sometimes we need to changes in our files so we have must have to clone our repository
  we write:  
          git clone https://.... (means url of the repository)

6) Atlast download Desktop for github account for graphical representation (desktop.github.com)
   then clone our repository of the github account
